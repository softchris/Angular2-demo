# Angular 2 Demos

The idea is to showcase different features in Angular 2

## Routing with router guards
src/app/admin currently showcases a component + a router guard

## Template forms
src/app/hero currently showcases Template forms with some simple validation

## CRUD + Pipe
scr/app/products showcases how you can build a CRUD + pipe
start looking from product.container.component.ts

## Custom rendering of html
Sometimes you don't want to specify a template html or inline template but want to render custom html.
This is how you can do it. Look at home.component.ts for an example and common/html.outlet.directive.ts
